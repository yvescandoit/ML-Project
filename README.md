# ML-Project

## OverView
This is my final project for the Practical Machine Learning Course of Johns Hopkins University.
In this project, I will be training a number of Prediction models using different Machine Learning algorithms while also providing a detailed report outlining my model-building process,
how cross-validation was applied and the accuracy behind those Prediction models. Additionally, I will apply my most accurate predictive model to predict the outcomes for 20 distinct test cases.
